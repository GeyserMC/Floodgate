# Connect Java Release Process

This rule documents the complete release workflow for Connect Java plugins across all platforms (Velocity, BungeeCord, Spigot/Paper).

## Current Release Configuration

- **Release Branch**: `connect`
- **Current Version**: Check [build.gradle.kts](mdc:build.gradle.kts) line 9
- **Platforms**: Velocity, BungeeCord, Spigot/Paper
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions via [release.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/release.yml)

## Release Artifacts

Each release produces these platform-specific JARs:

- **`connect-spigot.jar`** - For Spigot/Paper servers
- **`connect-velocity.jar`** - For Velocity proxy
- **`connect-bungee.jar`** - For BungeeCord proxy

Built via shadow plugin configuration in [connect.shadow-conventions.gradle.kts](mdc:build-logic/src/main/kotlin/connect.shadow-conventions.gradle.kts).

## Release Types

### 1. Versioned Release (Tag-based)

**Trigger**: Push git tag matching `*.*.*` pattern
**Creates**:

- GitHub release with tag name (e.g., `0.7.0`)
- JARs named `connect-{platform}-{version}.jar`
- Updates `latest` release tag
- Standard JARs named `connect-{platform}.jar`

### 2. Pre-release (Branch-based)

**Trigger**: Push to `connect` branch without tag
**Creates**:

- GitHub pre-release with `latest-prerelease` tag
- JARs named `connect-{platform}-prerelease.jar`

## Step-by-Step Release Process

### 1. Pre-Release Checks

```bash
# Ensure all platforms build successfully
./gradlew build

# Verify all fixes are working:
# - Velocity: no event loop incompatibilities
# - BungeeCord: no "channel not registered" errors
# - Spigot/Paper: no IllegalAccessException on handshake
```

### 2. Version Update

Edit [build.gradle.kts](mdc:build.gradle.kts):

```kotlin
allprojects {
    group = "com.minekube.connect"
    version = "0.7.0" // Update this line
    // ...
}
```

### 3. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add build.gradle.kts
git commit -m "Release version 0.7.0"
git push origin connect
```

### 4. Create and Push Tag (Let Workflow Handle Releases)

The workflow is designed to automatically create releases when tags are pushed. **Do not create releases manually via GitHub UI** - this will conflict with the automated release creation.

```bash
git tag 0.7.0
git push origin 0.7.0
```

The workflow will automatically create:
1. **Versioned release** (`0.7.0`) with JARs named `connect-{platform}-0.7.0.jar`
2. **Latest release** (`latest`) with standard JAR names

### 5. Monitor Release

- Check GitHub Actions workflow completion
- Verify 2 releases created:
  1. **Versioned release** (`0.7.0`) - Created by workflow with versioned JARs
  2. **Latest release** (`latest`) - Updated by workflow with standard JAR names

## GitHub Actions Workflow

The [release.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow:

**Environment**:

- Ubuntu latest
- JDK 17 (Temurin distribution)
- Gradle build action

**Build Process**:

1. Checkout code
2. Setup Java and Gradle
3. Run `./gradlew build`
4. Copy JARs from `{platform}/build/libs/connect-{platform}.jar`
5. Create releases with appropriate naming

**Release Logic**:

- **Tag push**: Creates versioned + latest releases
- **Branch push**: Creates pre-release only

## Version Numbering

**Pattern**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (semantic versioning)

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to injection or API
- **MINOR**: New platform support, significant features
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, compatibility updates

**Recent versions**: 0.6.2 → 0.7.0 (next)

## Release Verification

After release, verify:

1. **GitHub Releases**: All 3 releases created with correct JARs
2. **JAR Integrity**: Download and verify JAR file sizes/contents
3. **Platform Testing**:
   - Deploy to test servers
   - Verify injection works without errors
   - Test player connections through Connect network

## Rollback Process

If release has critical issues:

```bash
# Delete problematic tag
git tag -d 0.7.0
git push origin :refs/tags/0.7.0

# Delete GitHub releases manually via web interface
# Fix issues and re-release with patch version (0.7.1)
```

## Pre-Release Testing

For testing unreleased changes:

1. Push to `connect` branch (without tag)
2. Use JARs from `latest-prerelease` release
3. Test on staging environments
4. When stable, create official release tag

## Common Release Issues

- **Build failures**: Check Java/Gradle compatibility in workflow
- **Missing JARs**: Verify shadow plugin configuration
- **Wrong versions**: Ensure [build.gradle.kts](mdc:build.gradle.kts) version updated
- **Tag conflicts**: Delete and recreate tags if needed

## Workflow Design

**Why the workflow uses command-line tags:**

- **Automated release creation**: The workflow creates releases automatically when tags are pushed
- **Multiple release types**: Creates both versioned (`0.7.0`) and latest (`latest`) releases
- **Artifact management**: Handles JAR naming and upload automatically
- **Conflict avoidance**: Manual GitHub UI releases conflict with the automated "Release version" step (lines 82-90)
