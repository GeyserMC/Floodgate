/**
 * In Floodgate the PacketBlocker is used to temporarily prevent packets from being decoded. A
 * similar system is used to prevent packets from being handled while Floodgate is processing the
 * login. The old system blocked the thread which was processing the Floodgate login, but that
 * doesn't only block the packets for that specific user, it's shared between multiple users causing
 * them to lag or sometimes timeout.
 * <br>
 * The reason why we prevent packets from being handled is because keeping the packet order is
 * important. That is also the reason why we prevent packets from being decoded during that time.
 * The 'login start' packet for example can only be decoded after the handshake packet has been
 * handled, because the server can only successfully decode the packet after the handshake packet
 * caused the server to switch to the login state.
