**Special thanks goes to the [GeyserMC](https://github.com/GeyserMC) developers for their Floodgate
and GeyserMC open source projects.** This repository forks Floodgate and only reuses its phenomenal
project layout for our plugin as well as the very similar internal player connection injection
methods applied. Note that our plugin is completely different from Floodgate and Geyser plugins as
it differs in functionality and should work alongside those as we have refactored our plugin to work
isolated from the upstream.
