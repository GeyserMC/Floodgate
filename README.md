#### This is a fork of [Floodgate](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate) with components that are already included in Geyser, stripped out. This prevents [errors](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate/issues/178) that are caused by usage of the Floodgate API when both Geyser and Floodgate are installed on BungeeCord or Velocity. This only needs to be installed when a plugin is using the Floodgate API.

Hybrid mode plugin to allow for connections from [Geyser](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser) to join online mode servers.

Geyser is an open collaboration project by [CubeCraft Games](https://cubecraft.net).

See the [Floodgate](https://wiki.geysermc.org/floodgate/) section in the GeyserMC Wiki for more info about what Floodgate is, how you setup Floodgate and known issues/caveats. Additionally, it includes a more in-depth look into how Floodgate works and the Floodgate API.
